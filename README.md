- join our team - choose a career less ordinary-

# A bit of background….
We are the leading gifting marketplace business in the UK, supporting over 5,500 small independent businesses. Our technology is mostly built in house and supported by a passionate and fun engineering group. We’re about to embark on an ambitious new phase of development to advance our technology including platform re-architecture to modern microservices and rewriting the front end. This will include moving all the services to cutting edge tech and introducing new big data & machine learning platforms.  It’s an exciting time and we need to strengthen and grow our teams!

# What we can offer you

Because we know how important learning is, we provide the Tech team with online training and time set aside to complete course work, guilds sessions, hackathons and learning groups. On top of this, we offer plenty of fun stuff - staff discount, birthday vouchers, soft/hot drinks on tap, regular Friday drinks and of course our renowned Christmas and Summer parties. As the home of thoughtful gifts, thoughtful is our middle name so we also love a surprise or two… (but that’s enough on that for now!)

# Our perks 

It’s important to us that our people are well looked after, which is why we offer everyone BUPA healthcare, life insurance and a pension plan. Because having a break is important for your physical and mental wellbeing, our holiday allowance is 25 days (plus bank holidays) AND your entitlement will increase an extra day for every 2 years you spend with us.

Fantastic maternity policy
Parental leave policy
