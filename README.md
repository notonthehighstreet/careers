# A bit of background….
We are the leading gifting marketplace business in the UK, supporting over 5,500 small independent businesses. Our technology is mostly built in house and supported by a passionate and fun engineering group. We’re about to embark on an ambitious new phase of development to advance our technology including platform re-architecture to modern microservices and rewriting the front end. This will include moving all the services to cutting edge tech and introducing new big data & machine learning platforms.  It’s an exciting time and we need to strengthen and grow our teams!
